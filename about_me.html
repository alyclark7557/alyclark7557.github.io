        <p>As already mentioned, my name is Aly Clark, and I am an entry-level Software Developer from Columbia, Maryland! I went into
            Computer Science because I have a fondness for problem-solving and logic puzzles. It's always been a hobby of mine to do 
            those logic puzzle books with the grids so coding logic was just a step up from that! <br>

                As far as my educational background is concerned, I went to James Madison University in Virginia for my B.S in Computer Science
                with a minor in Mathematics! In my undergrad, I especially enjoyed my web development classes as well as my algorithms course.
                Both of those classes really honed my attention to detail, with my algorithms class allowing me to further my knowledge of the 
                Python programming language! Another lesson learned from my undergraduate studies was that I really like hard math problems. In 
                particular, I loved my upper level Calculus and Differential Equations classes. <br>

                After completing my undergraduate degree, I sought to continue learning by starting my graduate program with the University of 
                Maryland Global Campus! Because of the online nature, it allowed me to continue working 4-6 days a week as a waitress while still
                practicing my skills as a developer and engineer. After 2 years, I successfully completed my M.S in Software Engineering with a 4.0
                and the President's List! <br>

        <p>
            Now that I have finished my education, I have been taking on the job hunt while also pursuing some personal projects that I am particularly
            passionate about! <br><br>
            
            Thanks for reading a little bit about me! <br><br>P.S There's some cute dog photos below!<br><br>
